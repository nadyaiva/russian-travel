# Yandex Practicum project: Travel Russia

This —Åross-browser and adaptive landing page about Russian travel destinations.
The project was coded with only CSS using the BEM methodology (class structure and naming).

This is the second practical work during Yandex Practicum education course. In this project I:

- used design layout in Figma;
- connected custom fonts;
- Implemented media queries to make layout adaptive

### Plans for improvement:

- adding all vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility.

The result is on GitHub pages - [https://nadyaiva.github.io/russian-travel/] (here).
