# Yandex Practicum project: Travel Russia

This is the —Åross-browser and adaptive landing page about Russian travel destinations.
The project was coded with CSS using the BEM methodology (class structure and naming).

This is the second practical work during Web Development course. In this project I:

- Implemented media queries to make layout adaptive;
- used design layout in Figma;
- connected custom fonts;

### Plans for improvement:

- adding all vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility.

The result is on GitHub pages - [here] (https://nadyaiva.github.io/russian-travel/).
